And I also develop front end, when I need to pretend I'm a designer.<br>⚙️ Code, coffee and memes are my fuels. In my spare time, I conduct language research<br>and I learn new content in addition to why we still press F5 in the middle of 2024.<br>🖱️ If something isn't working, the bug is a feature</p>
